   There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
   You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31
   dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why
   it's impossible).

   total grid = 8X8 - 2 = 62
   31 x 2 = 62

   on wich row or column at 8, it is always one grid empty.
