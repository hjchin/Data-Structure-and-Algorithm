        You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but
        no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs
        are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

        5 quart jug, 3 quart jug

        1. Full 5 quart jug, pour into 3 quart jug, get 2 quart water.
        2. pour 2 quart water into 3 quart jug. 3 quart jug is with 2 quart water. balance in 3 quart jug is 1 quart.
        3. Full 5 quart jug, pour into 3 quart jug. Only 1 quart of water being poured into 3 quart jug.
        4. 5 quart jug now is with 4 quart of water.
