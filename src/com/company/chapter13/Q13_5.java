/*
    TreeMap, HashMap, LinkedHashMap: Explain the differences between TreeMap, HashMap, and
    LinkedHashMap. Provide an example of when each one would be best.

    Answer:
    1. TreeMap. sorted item. time complexity is O(lg N) for insertion and retrieval.
    2. HashMap. order is arbitrary. insertion and retrieval time complexity is O(1).
    2. LinkedHashMap. order follow the insertion order. Insertion and retrieval time complexity is O(1).

    Usage:
    1. if you need order, use treeMap.
    2. if you need insertion order, use linkedHashMap.
    3. if hashMap as default. no order is required.
